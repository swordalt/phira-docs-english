# Unlock Video

The unlock video feature allows for an unlock video to play before the chart commences.  (Think Spasmodic/Igallta; before your play the chart it shows a video first.)

## How To Implement

At the moment the unlock video system has not been fully implemented yet.

1. In your chart folder (the folder which contains your chart file, audio, illustration, etc.), add in your unlock video video.
2. In the same directory, find the file 'info.yml'.  Find the line 'unlockVideo', and add the name of your unlock video.
3. Re-zip your chart up and import it into Phira.

## Notes

1. Your video should use the H264 video codec and flac, aac, wav, mp3, or vorbis (ogg) audio format.
2. Remember that Phira has a file size limit when uploading your chart!
